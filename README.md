This project is made in the purpose of getiing a possibility to build an interface to generate an **integrated info** from all [GOOGLE CLOUDS](https://cloud.google.com/developers/) including *API's, Application Sripts, Application Engine; Cloud Storage, Cloud Datastore, Cloud SQL, Cloud Endpoints* etc. 

It aim to have the access to all available program language like *Python, Java, PHP, Go with possible also Scala and Ruby* and run them in the **same time** in to a SINGLE PAGE using a SINGLE DOMAIN without even need any sub domains!

##Languange Structure
In order to run all program language in the same time then they are configurated as below:
- **Python** is used to access all images with an access to any Image Manipulation run from Phython Frame such as *Django* and compiled as default module.
- **Java** is used to access all javascript file with an access to Servlet Application run from Java / Javascript Framework such as *GWT (Google Web Toolkit)* and compiled as script module.
- **PHP** is used to generate the front page run from PHP Framework such as *Zend, Kohana* etc and collected alltogether in a frontend module.
- **Go** is used to access any application that Support for *Docker images* in Google Cloud Platform with an intention to have a possibility to run and gain access a global structure application that run in other languages such as *Perl, C, C++, etc*. 

##Communication Structure
Having possibility to run all language then we have no more resistant to use the interface to any other [GOOGLE PRODUCT](https://developers.google.com/products/) Google Products including *Google Talk, Google Play Androids, Google Maps, Google Drive, Google Analytics, Google AdWords, Google Wallet, Youtube, etc* which also open an access to more widely and global application such as *Compute Engine and Big Query*.
